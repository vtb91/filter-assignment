    <p>
      Home price valuations in the United States climbed for the 70th-consecutive month signifying a booming housing market, particularly in the solid economies of the West and other areas scarred by the housing crises a decade ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data released on Tuesday from the <a href="https://us.spindices.com/index-family/real-estate/sp-corelogic-case-shiller">S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index,</a> which compares the prices of single-family homes across the US, rose
      6.3% in February, up from a 6.1% year-over-year increase reported in January.
    </p>
    <p>
      National home prices have been rising largely uninterrupted for the past five years, and the growth shows few signs of stopping any time soon because supply is constrained. Homes have now gained back the value lost during the Great Recession and are now
      as high as they’ve ever been. Last month’s data reported a 6.2% annual gain for all nine US census divisions in January, down from 6.3% the previous month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seattle has held the title of the nation’s hottest housing market for 18 months. Las Vegas and San Francisco are the second and third fastest-rising housing markets and the only other markets with double digit annual gains.

      “The West Coast has a lot of built-in advantages that make it a pretty attractive place to live to begin with: The weather is relatively pleasant, the scenery is gorgeous and the quality of life can be quite high.” said Aaron Terrazas, Senior Economist
      at Zillow. “Additionally, many West Coast cities are experiencing tremendous job growth, particularly tech hotbeds like Seattle and the Bay Area. Jobs in tech often pay very well, and these workers can typically afford to spend more on housing.”
    </P>
    <p>
      As Millenials enter their prime home buying years during a period of strong economic performance –demand for homes are exceeding what is available in the market, thus generating high prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The housing market looks largely healthy from a 50,000-foot view” said Terrazas. “But on the ground, the situation is much different, especially for younger, first-time buyers or buyers of more modest means”.
